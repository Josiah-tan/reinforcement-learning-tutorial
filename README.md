# Interactive Reinforcement Learning Course
This course will take you from complete beginner to reinforcement-learing aficionado over 5 lessons. Each file comes with explanatory comments and exercises to help you develop your understanding of reinforcement learning!

By our estimates, you could take:
- Roughly 1 hour to run and comprehend each of the files provided;
- Roughly 1 day to fully read and comprehend each of the files;
- Roughly 2 days to complete all the basic exercises in each file;
- Roughly 5 days, if you're a programming expert, to complete all the challenge exercises in each file.  

## Requisite knowledge
To get through this course smoothly, you should be confident with python. If you want a refresher, we've got a tutorial for you over here: https://github.com/usydroboticsclub/python 

You would also benefit from:
- Some experience with abstract problem solving
- The ability to read code and understand it, regardless of how much/little commenting there is
- A basic understanding of neural networks
But give it a go! We trust in your ability to learn :)
